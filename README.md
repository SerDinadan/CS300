Module 8 Reflection

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
•	The problems being solved in the projects of this course revolved around the creation of a suitable data structure to hold and parse data from a file.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
•	I approached the problem by considering the major types of data structures introduced in the course and evaluating which would be suitable for the project.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
•	I overcame roadblocks by looking through the code of previous assignments, looking through examples in the textbook, and google searching.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
•	This course has given me a greater awareness of the different ways or methods in which one can work with data when developing a program 

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
•	These projects have given me a greater appreciation of the modularity of OOP. This modularity was beneficial in carrying forward code into the final project.
